## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth

### Development Guidelines
- Follow Windows PowerShell commands for all terminal operations
- Use shadcn components for UI consistency
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
- Prioritize validation over modification
